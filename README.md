What is a Ransomware?

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts files, making them inaccessible. It spreads through emails, downloads, or system vulnerabilities. Attackers demand a ransom for the decryption key, usually in cryptocurrency. Ransomware targets financial gain by exploiting fear and urgency. It uses strong encryption algorithms to lock files and displays a ransom note with payment instructions. Prevention is key, as paying the ransom doesn't guarantee decryption. Regular updates, antivirus software, and user education help protect against ransomware attacks.
